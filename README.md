# Hello everyone ðŸŒ¸ 

<p>
I created this project to deepen my understanding of React Native through hands-on implementation. Along the way, I documented key concepts and insights that I believe will serve as a valuable reference when revisiting this project. Detailed documentation is crucial for navigating older projects effectively, so take your time, stay focused, and don't get discouraged!
</p>

<h3>ðŸ’™ Enjoy this journey into the world of React Native! ðŸ’™</h3>

This is an [Expo](https://expo.dev) project created with [`create-expo-app`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/create-expo-app).

## project Set-up bash commands ðŸ¤—

```bash

npx create-expo-app@latest
npm run reset-project
```

### STEP 1 : make sure that your react native app works 

```js
  the first step is to create app folder and _layout.jsx and index.jsx files and return any text

```
### STEP 2 : How to add font in your react native app ðŸ˜ª

```js
Modify Fonts 
Go to google fonts and choose your app font
--> Download the font
--> Extract the folder 
--> go to static folder
--> copy the files of fonts you want
--> paste them in the ./assets/fonts
now to use fonts :
--> go to _layout.jsx :

import {useFonts} from "expo-font"
  useFonts({
    'Outfit':require('./../assets/fonts/Outfit-Regular.ttf'),
    'Outfit-Medium':require('./../assets/fonts/Outfit-Medium.ttf'),
    'Outfit-Bold':require('./../assets/fonts/Outfit-Bold.ttf'),
  })
  --> go to index.jsx :
<View>
<Text style={{fontFamily: 'Outfit-Medium',}}> Hola!</Text> 
</View>
      
    
```
### STEP 3 : React Native Authentication ðŸ¤¨

```js
--> create login folder inside app folder
--> create a navigation link and make sure you can navigate between home and Login Screen 
--> Design the log in screen
---> GOOGLE authentication
---> use authentication using Clerk "https://clerk.com/" ( go to product then click user Authentication / create an account // crate app // choose expo )

    ---> create .env file
    ---> Install dependencies
```
```bash
npm i react-native-web @expo/metro-runtime
npm install @clerk/clerk-expo
npm install expo-secure-store


```

<h2> Disadvantages of Using Clerk </h2>
While Clerk offers many advantages, there are some potential drawbacks to consider:
<ul>


<li>If Clerk experiences downtime, your app's authentication system may also fail unless you have fallback mechanisms.</li>
<li>You're relying on their pricing model, and significant cost increases could affect your budget.
Limited Customization</li>

<li>Pre-built components may not fit your exact design or user experience requirements without additional effort.
Customizing advanced authentication flows might be more challenging compared to building them from scratch.
Cost</li>

<li>Clerk is a paid service, so it might not be ideal for small projects or startups with limited budgets. While they have a free tier, it might not meet the needs of larger-scale applications.
Vendor Lock-In</li>

<li>If you rely heavily on Clerk and decide to switch to another service or build your own system later, migrating users and data can be complex.
Limited Offline Functionality</li>

<li>Applications that need offline authentication or functionality may find Clerk less suitable since it relies on external servers for most processes.</li>


</ul>

<h2>Conclusion</h2>

<p>If you need a quick, secure, and scalable solution, Clerk is a great choice. However, if you want complete control over your authentication system and donâ€™t mind the extra work, building it yourself might be more suitable.</p>
